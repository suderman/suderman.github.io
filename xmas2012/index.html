  Hark! Jon Suderman's 2012 Newsletter!</h1>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  A</span>s expected,</strong> the week between Christmas and New Years prompts pensive reflections on the twelve months gone by. Twenty-twelve was very good to me and I'm feeling over-blessed. As is the tradition (and until you ask me to stop), I'll recap my life's narrative this past year:
</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/snow.jpg" width="300" height="380" /> 

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  J</span>anuary 2012 springboarded a lot of new experiences my way,</strong> thanks to my budding relationship with Janessa. We had been matched on eHarmony in November and had our first date one month later at the <a href="http://www.calgaryzoo.com/zoolights/">Calgary Zoo</a>. All of a sudden, my recreational time was filled with frequent visits to the country, horseback riding, and <em><a href="http://www.albertadancesport.com/workshops/index.aspx">even dancing lessons!</a></em> We embarked on our first escapade snowshoeing across the Alberta-British Columbia border to <a href="http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/facility/elklakes.html">Elk Lakes Cabin</a> (this was winter beauty at its finest). And on many occasions, my ears were treated to personal concerts, courtesy of Nessie's musical talent. Life was really, really good. :-) </p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  F</span>ebruary was loaded with adventure!</strong> We started off with a weekend getaway to the Banff Springs Hotel, along with the dodgeball team&mdash;the roster including Andrew, Jessica, Braden, Dan &amp; Emily, Doreen, Donna &amp; Ross (Honeybadgers don't care)! Thanks to the goodness of Doreen (and Andrew's pestering), I've had the treat of staying in that castle more often than what's fair!

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
And that was only the beginning, because the next week, Janessa, Andrew, Jess and I hopped a plane to meet the Leclairs (Uncle Andy, Aunt LaVonne, cousins Jayden &amp; Jenna) in Tampa, Florida. We spent the day at Busch Gardens (it's a rollercoaster zoo!) before meeting my parents and grandparents on a Caribbean cruise ship, destined for family-fun-time! Mom <em>loves</em> family-fun-time. After visiting Grand Cayman, Cozumel, Belize (<em>it was un-belize-able!</em>) and Roat&aacute;n, Janessa took the main stage braving 2000 fans and performed as Britney Spears in the cruise ship's singing competition spectacular. Really! Complete with costume and backup-dancers, she brought down the ship!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
Back on land, we rounded off the trip with our obligatory visit to Walt Disney World and got our fix of Mickey-magic. The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8_znMKh8qM">Fantasyland expansion</a> wasn't open yet, but that's the perfect excuse to visit again soon. We also couldn't pass up Universal Studio's Islands of Adventure to see the new <a href="http://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/">Wizarding World of Harry Potter</a> and gulp down our very first butter beer! Shockingly, there isn't any actual <em>beer</em> in it.</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  M</span>arch was a chance to take a breather from all the travelling.</strong> It was also time for me to begin my training as the Calgary Marathon was only three months away! With the help of my boss and his big truck, I purchased a (<em>very heavy</em>) gym-grade treadmill for my basement. It's actually the exact same model I used to run on at the gym. So long, 8-year membership at the YMCA! And to make sure the treadmill didn't become an expensive laundry rack, I installed a 39" TV on the wall with a 5.1 surround-sound system to keep me active. It's fantastic motivation!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/maui.jpg" width="250" height="245" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  A</span>pril kicked off with the annual pranks one expects.</strong> This year, Jessica shrink-wrapped my car (Andrew's too!) but we were quick to retaliate. She left incriminating evidence at the crime scene (her cell phone), so we returned it... secured to the ceiling (where she would hear it ring, but never be able to find). Additionally, we nailed shut her bedroom with a large <em>CONDEMNED</em> sign. Ahh... brotherly satisfaction!</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/beach.jpg" width="300" height="324" /> 

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">After that April foolishness, I joined Ness and her family in Maui for a little Hawaiian relaxation. I stayed in some random lady's house (<a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/">Airbnb</a>) only a short walk away from Ness, Luke and her parents, Kevin &amp; Connie. I experienced my first tropical Easter&mdash;complete with a Polynesian-style worship service and a Cadbury mini-egg hunt! They spoiled me and I loved it. It took great discipline, but I stuck to my marathon training schedule and enjoyed the most beautiful (and warmest!) training runs I've ever done. Once those were out of the way, it was all white sand and shaved ice. Hawaii is heavenly and it won't surprise me if I find myself living there one day. Oh, and in case you ever visit Maui, go see <a href="http://www.warrenandannabelles.com/">Warren &amp; Annabelle's Magic Show</a>... but beware of Little Beach&mdash;it's all naked and awkward.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/marathon.jpg" width="312" height="398" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  M</span>ay involved a lot of running!</strong> I was very proud of Janessa when she agreed to participate in the city's <a href="http://www.mdrunandwalk.com/">Mother's Day race</a> and completed 5k with the rest of my family (I'm also proud of your 10k's, Mom &amp; Dad, Andrew, Jess &amp; Braden!). Perhaps next year we'll convince Connie to join us? When the end of the month arrived, I was excited/nervous to finally run in the 42k <a href="http://www.calgarymarathon.com/">Calgary Marathon</a>. I hadn't participated in this race for several years, and it was an awesome experience for me. Janessa followed my progress and met me throughout the course at multiple mile markers&mdash;what a cheerleader! I finished 679/975 with a time of 4:32:10 (my new personal best!).</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/sumo.jpg" width="344" height="330" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  J</span>une rang in my 30th birthday&mdash;gasp!</strong> Thanks to the highly secretive efforts from my mom and girlfriend (she tried <em>so</em> hard to be sneaky!), I was treated to a surprise birthday party featuring sushi and sumo suits&mdash;a flattering outfit for any aging  fellow! Ness gave me rollerblades, which triggered a new summer activity. I hadn't walked on wheels since I was a little kid, and quickly learned the importance of braking! </p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  I wasn't all done with running, though. My dad and I participated in a new race&mdash;the <a href="http://www.millarvillehalfmarathon.com/">Millarville Half Marathon</a>. It was south of the city and the rolling green hills were Hobbiton-esque. I finished 53/263 with a time of 1:48:36. Later, the dodgeball team headed west to stay at the Chateau Lake Louise (thanks again, Doreen)! Our attempt at hiking was cut short by massive amounts of snow blocking the trail and refusing to melt for us! Unfortunately, winter lingers in the mountains. North of the city, I experienced my first <a href="http://www.sundrerodeo.com/">Sundre Rodeo</a> with Janessa and her folks. My favourite event has to be the Wild Cow Milking... it doesn't get much weirder than that!</p>

<img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/july.jpg" width="650" height="384" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">
  J</span>uly 1st is Canada Day</strong> and I spent the day with Ness rafting the Bow River and watching fireworks at <a href="http://www.calgaryarea.com/calgary_parks/princess_island_park/princess.htm">Prince's Island Park</a>. It was the Calgary Stampede's centennial year and we had company (Uncle Roy &amp; Aunt Jeanine, Uncle Rod &amp; Aunt Betty Jo) visit for that, plus our annual "Christmas in July" extravaganza&mdash;complete with carols and gifts under the tree! That same month, I saw many of Janessa's relatives at Kevin &amp; Connie's, celebrating her grandparents' 50th anniversary. There was an abundance of food and the "family band" played Elvis hits all afternoon. I love visiting where Ness grew up&mdash;they built a log house on 40 acres of woodland with a pond and four horses. We usually stay a couple weekends every month as I attempt to level-up my elite horse riding skills!</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/mud.jpg" width="380" height="380" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  This year had one more race to tackle, and again Janessa made me very proud. We ran the <a href="http://www.mudhero.com/">Mud Hero</a> 6k obstacle course over climbing walls and through pits of mud on our bellies. She ran the whole distance (without stopping) along with Jess &amp; Braden, and we all finished <em>extremely filthy!</em> Good times before I had to drive Ness to the airport and say goodbye&mdash;for the next three weeks, Ness would be travelling the world on a <a href="http://www.contiki.com/destinations/europe/tours">Contiki Tour</a> of Europe, leaving me to fend for myself... <em>gulp!</em></p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">
  A</span>ugust began with a family camping trip in Radium Hot Springs,</strong> along with the Leclairs visiting from Winnipeg. Hot springs and hiking is great fun, but I was admittedly distracted and spent a lot of time attempting to keep in contact with Ness. The love-sickness&mdash;it got me!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/brighton.jpg" width="344" height="330" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  This problem was soon remedied when I flew to the United Kingdom to meet Janessa at the tail end of her tour. It sure felt like a lot longer than three weeks when I finally caught up with Ness on the train departing Gatwick! We spent the next ten days in bliss, visiting her relatives in Brighton, Southampton and Cornwall&mdash;all phenomenal people who made our trip really memorable. A north-bound train took us past sheep-dotted fields to Edinburgh, Scotland to see the Military Tattoo, leaving the last three days to soak up London, England. I've visited Europe before, but this was my first time in Great Britain and it sure is convenient how everything is written in English. Also, cream tea is <em>not</em> to be missed! It's a fascinating place crammed with history and we had a jolly good time. :-) </p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  Ness and I returned home in time for another mountainous hike with my church's Outdoor Club, trekking up to <a href="http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/facility/bow.html">Bow Hut</a>. It's situated next to the glacier which happens to be the water source for the river we rafted in July. Ness and Jess continued to bond on this trip, ultimately moving my secret plans forward. More on <em>that</em> in September...</p>


<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/horses.jpg" width="260" height="245" />


<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">
  S</span>eptember signaled the end of summer and the start of new beginnings.</strong> Ness and I helped Jess move to Edmonton for school&mdash;her first time out of the nest. We made a trip out of it and first visited Janessa's parents for horse riding, then spent an afternoon at West Edmonton Mall's waterpark, and had dinner with <a href="http://brocktyler.bandcamp.com/album/lights/">Brock</a> &amp; Karmyn.</p>


<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  Janessa's 25th birthday had come, and she invited my family, her family, and her relatives over for the big celebration. Little did she know I had ulterior motives in motion! I began by decorating the house with younger photos of her (of course), <em>AND</em> photos of the two of us (all romantic-like). I enlisted her mother's help and assembled a slideshow highlighting Janessa's years growing up. Halfway through, the slideshow <em>changed</em>. Now, there were pictures of the two of us, musically accompanied by the first song she performed for me. At the slideshow's denouement, Andrew &amp; Luke simultaneously unravelled an 8'x4' banner, proclaiming the question printed in large letters, <em>"Janessa: Will you marry me?"</em> I was already on one knee, ring presented, nervously reciting my proposal. ...she said "yes" without hesitation! Champaign was poured, and with our families already present, we had our engagement party right then and there. That felt good. <em>Real good</em>.</p>

<img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2012/proposal.jpg" width="650" height="384" />


  <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
    And yes, I <em>did</em> ask for her parents' blessing first and they lovingly accepted me from the start. My mom &amp; dad were spectacularly supportive the whole journey and I really appreciate how much they love Janessa. And special thanks to Jessica's investigative efforts, shopping assistance from Andrew and Malinda, and everyone else for helping me with the part I'm most clueless&mdash;picking her perfect engagement ring!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">
  Post-proposal, I took Ness on another dangerous hike to reach <a href="http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/facility/abbot.html">Abbot Pass hut</a>. We ascended with my family and the Outdoor Club to stay the night in a 90-year-old stone hut on the top of the world. Later, I was enlisted in scuba diving lessons, courtesy of my bosses Darron and Robb. They're both scuba junkies and just wanted to share their subaqueous obsession! I passed the written exam and pool sessions, but I think I'll be waiting for warmer weather before finishing the open water dives!</p>

  O</span>ctober featured two Thanksgiving feasts but only one food coma.</strong> The weekends were busy because Janessa needed to move out. She had been living in the house her (recently passed) grandparents once owned, but it finally had been sold. Ness moved in with her brother Luke, and will be staying with him until the wedding next summer. The wedding venue was decided, too! We chose to exchange vows at the Calgary Zoo (and for those of you <em>not paying attention</em>, that's the location of our first date!). </p>

  N</span>ovember was getting colder and darker, but Christmas was on its way!</strong> One snowy weekend, we travelled to <a href="http://www.rosebudtheatre.com/">Rosebud Theatre</a> to take in their holly jolly musical&mdash;and we loved it. The next day, we dino-dashed to Drumheller to prey upon the prehistoric predators at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. <em>Rawr!</em> Later, Andrew and I decked the halls in preparation for our 4th Annual November Christmas Party at Sudermanor. This year's theme was "tacky Christmas mug" and Dan was voted winner for his Tim Horton's paper cup. It's also worth noting that this month marked my 5th year working at <a href="http://www.nonfiction.ca/">nonfiction studios</a>. I'm really blessed to have such a fun job making the Internet bigger!</p>

  D</span>ecember was a month I didn't see very much of Janessa.</strong> She joined a community theatre group to perform in the pantomime, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t3Dp0iE2A">Aladdin</a>, at the Pumphouse Theatre in Calgary. This was a significant time commitment, but everyone loved seeing Ness sing and dance on stage&mdash;it's her natural environment! For Christmas itself, my immediate family and I flew to Vancouver, Washington. I hadn't spent a Christmas there since 1987! I felt nostalgic seeing my family together with Uncle Roy &amp; Aunt Jeanine, Uncle Rod &amp; Aunt Betty Jo, and cousins Christina, David &amp; Sara&mdash;all celebrating Christmas under the same roof! There was <em>so much</em> food! We made a lot of new memories, and hopefully more than just the one where I ralphed all over the <a href="http://www.thegrotto.org/christmas/">church</a> parking lot (don't ask)! Alas, my festive visit couldn't last longer, because Janessa was waiting for me back home. So I returned to my financ&eacute;e and did a second round of Christmas&mdash;this time with Ness and her folks. :-) </p>

  T</span>wenty-twelve was my last year as a bachelor&mdash;that's good news for me!</strong> By the looks of it, twenty-thirteen is shaping up to be an incredible year of change and I can't wait to see what God has in store for me and my almost-wife. Thanks for reading my annual journal entry. I hope your year-last was a blast and your year-next will be blessed. Until I spam you again..!</p>
