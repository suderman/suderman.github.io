And for the sake of tradition, once again I shall recap the plot summary of my life for 2010.</p>

                      <img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/snowman.jpg" width="250" height="290" />

For example, instead traveling to Orlando and running the Disney World Marathon, I stayed home. Home hasn't changed... it's still a cozy bi-level in Calgary, lorded over by the Brothers Suderman, along with our faithful friend, Braden. Work is much the same, as well. I'm still a web developer at nonfiction studios, but 2010 did ring in a new desk arrangement&mdash;I now work next to a window, instead of next to the bathroom.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/ski.jpg" width="328" height="377" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">F</span>ebruary was the month we finally took down the Christmas tree.</strong> It was also chance for skiing (I do this about once a year). Doreen, Donna, Ross, Glenn, Braden and I sojourned at the Chateau Lake Louse and inhaled many buffets at half-price (Doreen is our hotel-discount hook-up!). The high caloric intake demanded restitution, so later that month, Andrew and I participated in the Hypothermic Half Marathon. It's a cold 13 miles, but our spirits were warmed after witnessing Canada take home the gold in Olympic Hockey. So sorry, my American relatives!</p>

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">M</span>arch saw my new healthy lifestyle in full swing.</strong> I bought a <a style="color: #d10b0b; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.withings.com/">WiFi-enabled scale</a>, so that every time I stood on it, my weight would automatically be posted online, thus sticking me to my crappy 3-month diet (I really missed pizza and cake). But I kept my mind off food by having fun&mdash;my dodgeball team signed up for our first tournament, and we (amazingly) finished second-place! Many of my friends (and family) also happen to be dodgeball teammates, so it's great fun to play together regularly.<br><img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/dodgeball.jpg" width="650" height="453" /></p>

Mom and Jess were very busy at 4am! Later that month, we hosted Alex and friends, visiting from Winnipeg. And I kept myself busy with extra freelance work on the side, saving up for the very expensive month coming up next...</p>

                     <img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/rome.jpg" width="370" height="506" /> 

                     <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><br><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">M</span>ay kicked off with two races, testing out the new speed I gained in exchange for the weight I lost.</strong> The Theatre Calgary Big Run and the Mother's Day 10k scored some new personal bests for me! The hard work was done and the fun part was next.</p>

                     <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">I flew to Paris to join Andrew half-way through his big, fancy Europe trip! I missed London (Andrew's first week) and replaced Shawn (who went home), but our group (including Doreen and Sarah), went on to visit Rome, Pompeii, Milan and Monaco. Doreen's hotel connections made this trip far more luxurious than we could ever normally afford! (we often felt out of place&mdash;too fancy for us!) Having never crossed the Atlantic before, the trip was absolutely unforgettable&mdash;I was up to my eyeballs in history and culture. But... I really missed ice water, free public restrooms, and ketchup!</p>

<img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/fountain.jpg" width="650" height="498"  /> 

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">J</span>une arrived and that meant it was time for me to be twenty-eight.</strong> This unyielding count-up is beginning to concern me! I found a Jurassic Park pinball machine on Kijiji just so I can feel young again. Ah... faux youth. Also, with warm weather finally upon us, we hosted a summer party and watched an outdoor movie projected on the garage. I've always wanted to do that! To cap off the month, Andrew finally decided to get baptized. Well done, little brother!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/mom.jpg" width="330" height="372" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">J</span>uly featured the typical craziness of the Calgary Stampede.</strong> However, I had to duck out the Grandstand Show early to make it home in time for my mom's 50th birthday! We were extra sneaky this year and stealthily hid visitors from Washington&mdash;Uncle Rod, Aunt Betty Jo, Uncle Roy, and Aunt Jeanine. She was very surprised! Thanks to Aunt Betty Jo, I learned of my relation to Daniel Boone&mdash;we share the same grandparents or something. Boone was an American pioneer, explorer and frontiersman who fought in the Revolutionary War. He was captured by Shawnee Indians but later convinced them to adopt him into their tribe. Boone also settled a village called Boonesborough (ha!) and eventually earned a catchy <a style="color: #d10b0b; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://youtu.be/tjtewigG7nE">theme song</a>. Anyway, learning all this helps explain the origin of my own manliness and overall bad-ass prowess.</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/palm.jpg" width="200" height="251" /> 

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">Despite the miserably cold summer in Calgary, our last week of July really made up for it. My family and I flew to the island of Kauai in Hawaii and were later joined by Uncle Andy and Aunt LaVonne. We had a phenomenal time in paradise, chasing wild chickens, snorkeling Tunnel Beach, guzzling Longboards & Mai Tais, devouring Puka dogs & luau pigs, and hiking the Kalalau Trail as far as Hanakoa Falls. The scenery is so jaw-dropping, it pretty much spoils any future hikes anywhere else. Unfair Hawaiian advantage, I guess!</p>

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>ugust was my stretch of lazy summer at last.</strong> I stayed in town and was happy for it. The dodgeball team was thrilled to witness Ross and Donna wed, presumably after finding love on the dodgeball field (okay, not really). This was also the first year anniversary of Sudermanor, having moved in last August. Owning a house is a lot of fun, but also a lot of work! After an unfortunate assault against weeds using Roundup, the front lawn was finally showing signs of health again. Word of warning: don't use Roundup on your lawn!</p>

<img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/dodgeball2.jpg" width="650" height="314" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">S</span>eptember was the start of my new baking kick.</strong> It would seem I bake pies now! I realize it's not your typical, manly activity. The truth is, I just really like pie. Also, before summer's end, we squeezed in one more Banff hike and competed in our second dodgeball tournament. Go team: Three Wolf Moon! Arrrooo!!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/shoot.jpg" width="220" height="245" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">O</span>ctober gave opportunity to a unique team-building activity at nonfiction&mdash;shooting guns at stuff.</strong> For the first time, I fired a 9mm, 40 cal, .45, .44 magnum, beretta storm, and a shot gun (for good measure). Bam! Later, after filling up on Canadian Thanksgiving, I took another Doreen-trip (with Donna and Ross) to Edmonton, staying at the fancy Westin, and meeting Amanda for dinner and games. On Halloween, we had a family costume party, once again projecting <a style="color: #d10b0b; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://youtu.be/q99vg5SN-mQ">scary video</a> on the front window. This year we had fewer kids, but I like left-over candy, so it worked out.</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/santa.jpg" width="250" height="280" /> 

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">N</span>ovember was an excellent example of Canadian extremes for weather.</strong> Early that month, it was so beautiful and sunny, Braden and I went running outdoors. By the end of the month, it was so cold, snowy and miserable, I wanted to migrate back to Kauai. The only thing that makes winter worth all the trouble is Christmas, so we put up the tree by Remembrance Day, and threw our second annual November Christmas Party. Shortly after, I filled up again on American Thanksgiving.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2010/mixers.jpg" width="275" height="380" /> 

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">D</span>ecember came and I already felt like Christmas was running long</strong> (then I remembered the house had been decorated for over a month). I visited Edmonton a few more times and got to see Handel's Messiah, along with Amanda. Work closed down shop for Christmas week, so Amanda returned the favour and came to visit me between Christmas and New Year's. We drove to Banff and hiked the frozen version of Johnston Canyon&mdash;truly spectacular! Also, most my Christmas gifts were baking-related, including two KitchenAid mixers (apparently mom and Andrew don't communicate!). Hmm, I guess I'd better bake another pie...</p>

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>nd that's it!</strong> It's my hope that this electronic mail finds you healthy and that 2011 is good to you. God bless you and yours!</p>
