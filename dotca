Hi, I'm Jon from Calgary, Alberta.

I'm a Canadian web developer, working for a Canadian company, and earning Canadian dollars. So it would stand to reason I'd like my top level domains... Canadian.

Thankfully, our proud nation has entrusted this task to Canadian Internet Registration Authority. And well, they're alright!

Thanks to dot ca, I was able to build a Canadian website for my mom. A website with an address that's identifiably north of the 49th parallel,  and one letter shorter than the other guys. Mom's new website will help working parents find a loving dayhome for their child and provide her  business with an online presence, at last. 

You're welcome mom. And I'll be coming over for dinner tomorrow.
