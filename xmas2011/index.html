                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">I</span> bet you all thought I forgot, didn&#x27;t you? Wrongo!</strong> Once again, twelve months have passed and the time has come for another recap on Jon Suderman's year. So far, I&#x27;ve spammed my friends &amp; family with this particular newsletter <em>three times</em>; seeing how no one has complained yet, let&#x27;s up that count to <em>four!</em></p>

                      <img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/cake.jpg" width="250" height="290" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">J</span>anuary 2011 feels like a really long time ago.</strong> Plenty hasn&#x27;t changed since the previous year: I still live in the Calgary southwest, in a house co-owned with my brother, Andrew. Our delightful tenant, Braden, quietly occupies the basement. He complains very little; only my midnight snacking in the kitchen directly above his bedroom disturbs his slumber&hellip; an activity I ought not participate, in the first place. Across the dividing line, my parents live in the Calgary southeast, with my sister still under their wing. Cold Canadian winters prompt many visits, ever since they&#x27;ve installed their new hot tub. Given how delightful my company is, they don&#x27;t mind.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/car.jpg" width="328" height="297" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">F</span>ebruary was a much busier month!</strong> My dodgeball team packed our bags and road tripped northward for the Battle of Alberta tournament in Red Deer. How did we place? Well that&#x27;s not important. The <em>important</em> thing is that we had fun! (and that we did NOT place dead last...)</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">Next big event? I learned how to drive a manual transmission. This was out of necessity seeing how the car I bought wasn&#x27;t an automatic and I&#x27;ve never touched a clutch in my life. Yes, I finally retired the Squirrel-love breakfast-mobile (1993 Intrepid), and adopted a 2007 Imprezza. I love my lil' Subie, but <em>it</em> must have hated <em>me</em> those first few weeks; I stalled the poor engine more often than I care to recall. It was worth it, though! And now driving is fun again. :-)</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">Later that month, my siblings and dodgeball team packed our bags AGAIN. This time, the excuse was a trip to Las Vegas&mdash;escaping Calgary&#x27;s unforgiving weather. We stayed in the Paris hotel, watched Cirque Du Soleil, took in the Phantom of the Opera, shouted at the Tournament of Kings, and screamed during The Price is Right (&quot;Andrew Suderman, come on doooown!&quot;). Don't worry, mom; only wholesome memories in Sin City!</p>

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">M</span>arch hit, and we thought: why not join another dodgeball tournament?</strong> This one was &quot;country club&quot;-themed, and although we didn&#x27;t win the tourney, we DID win the best photo contest! And no, we did not actually <em>use</em> the tennis rackets while playing dodgeball. Later that month, we stayed at the Chateau Lake Louise for a ski-trip with Doreen and friends (as always, she&#x27;s our secret weapon against expensive hotels!). Ritzy buffets are delicious, but they're doubley-delicious at half the price! Doreen, you are never ever allowed to quit your Sheraton job. ;-)</p>

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>pril was the month my running kicked up a notch,</strong> in preparation for the Calgary Marathon. Even though some don&#x27;t mind trekking through <em>too</em> much snow, I prefer the safety of a treadmill and the entertainment of Disney movies to pass the time. Watching movies is epspecially helpful when your training schedule demands three hours of running! Later, Andrew, Braden and I ran the Theatre Calgary Big Run&mdash;a half marathon through Bowness Park. April was also the month for Easter! I wore my Sunday best&mdash;a collar shirt.</p>

                     <img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/finger.jpg" width="300" height="350" /> 

                     <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><br><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">M</span>ay kicked off with another familiar race&mdash;the Mother&#x27;s Day Run &amp; Walk.</strong> This is a 10k that my family and I have done for several years now and is a healthy alternative to serving mom a greasy breakfast in bed. RIGHT MOM? Sadly, this was also the month that threw a monkey wrench in my marathon training; I suffered my first broken bone when a dodgeball grazed my finger exactly the wrong way. Dan drove me to the hospital where the doctors set the bone and wrapped me up. Because of the cast, and the risk of unsetting the bone, the doc told me to skip the Calgary Marathon. I was pretty choked over that. Later, a proper splint was made for me, followed by many visits of physio. Breaking a bone is very annoying!</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/broken.jpg" width="328" height="246" />

                     <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">May wasn&#x27;t all bad though; towards the end of the month, we had a family road trip to Winnipeg to celebrate my grandpa&#x27;s 80th birthday. It was a long drive for a quick visit, but I had a blast seeing my Manitoba relatives again!</p>


                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">J</span>une arrived and I celebrated my last twenty-something birthday.</strong> Time relentlessly ticks on. With my finger healed up (enough), I was able to return to my marathon training. Yes, the Calgary Marathon was a miss, but I had a backup race: the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Seattle Marathon. The Sudermans set out on yet another family road trip&mdash;this time to visit the Berkans. Everybody in our group ran the half marathon, except for Andrew and I&mdash;we ran the full; making it my 5<sup>th</sup> full marathon. I really enjoyed this race; nearly every mile featured a live band, encouraging all the runners with their music. While in the area, we also caught a Mariners baseball game and later rode the ferry to Victoria.</p>

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">J</span>uly in Calgary means everybody cowboys up for Stampede,</strong> and this is especially true for me and my co-workers. The Calgary Stampede is a big client of nonfiction studios (we do many of their websites), and so once again, I received a gate pass for the event. This meant that every lunch hour, I would wander on the grounds (it&#x27;s only 5 minutes away) and find something horribly unhealthy to eat. Pizza-on-a-stick, deep-fried pop tarts, doughnut burgers; I found many ways to challenge my stomach. The 10 day event is a spectacle many locals pass on, but I love the whole thing. Yahoo!</p>


<img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/hike.jpg" width="650" height="417" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">A</span>ugust was a month of hiking and racing!</strong> My church formed a new outdoors club and had planned all sorts of adventures for us. Early in the month, we backpacked Yoho National Park, and after that, Ribbon Falls &amp; Guinn&#x27;s Pass. Before this, I&#x27;d never hiked with a tent on my back before, so it wasn&#x27;t until this summer I finally got a taste of what &quot;real&quot; camping is like! My conclusion? I prefer sleeping in a bed.</p>
                    
                    <img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/spartan.jpg" width="375" height="360" />   
                    
<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">As for racing, Jess and several friends of mine attempted Calgary&#x27;s first Spartan Race. It&#x27;s a 5 km obstacle course, with challenges like climbing over walls, carrying rocks uphill, and crawling under barbed wire through the mud. It was definitely the hardest 5 km I&#x27;ve ever run! However, this race was nothing compared to the race Andrew and Braden had next: Ironman Canada. It&#x27;s a formidable challenge: 3.8 km swim, 180 km bike, and 42 km run&mdash;this was Braden&#x27;s first Ironman, and Andrew&#x27;s fourth. The race was in Penticton and we made another family road trip (plus Doreen!) out of the event. It&#x27;s a fun race to watch and cheer on.</p>

<img src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/ironman.jpg" width="650" height="360" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">On the way back, we stopped to stay a night at the Banff Springs Hotel (thanks Doreen!) to celebrate Andrew and Braden's admirable efforts. The weather in Banff was crisp compared to Penticton, but had a fun time wandering the "castle" and exploring the area outside. Of course, we ate at our favourite restaurant, (which we&#x27;ve lovingly named &quot;Hagrid&#x27;s Hut&quot;) at the base of the castle.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/abbott.jpg" width="220" height="258" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">S</span>eptember was quieter,</strong> but the activities were similar to the previous month.</strong> My work participated in the Calgary Corporate Challenge and volunteered me for the 10 km race. And at the end of the month, my church had another overnight hike to Abbott Pass. I&#x27;ve hiked Lake O&#x27;Hara before, but I&#x27;ve never gone up to the pass before. At the top is a 90-year-old stone hut where our group spent the night. It was very remote and pretty amazing, actually! Recommended.</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/gumball.jpg" width="250" height="279" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first">O</span>ctober was the beginning of my parents&#x27; new floor.</strong> They wanted engineered hardwood, over nearly the entire main floor, and figured it&#x27;d be a fun family project to just do ourselves. No, we didn&#x27;t know a thing about flooring, and yes, it was a lot of work. It may have taken five separate weekends, but Andrew and I have earned a multitude of a free dinners as a result! Also, Thanksgiving and Halloween were fun and food-heavy as usual. I dressed up as a gum ball machine but nobody was able to guess my costume. I'll have to come up with something better next year.</p>

<img align="left" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/cannon.jpg" width="179" height="258" />

                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">N</span>ovember began with a trip to Portland, Oregon.</strong> Work sent me out that way for a conference, which was really fantastic despite the hipsters! I was also able to spend a couple days in Portland's neighbouring city: Vancouver, Washington. I hadn&#x27;t been out there since my grandfather&#x27;s funeral, and had a wonderful time staying with Uncle Roy &amp; Aunt Jeanine, and visiting Uncle Rod, Aunt Betty-Jo, with cousins David &amp; Christina. I've never been there all on my own before, so this time I had all their attention to <em>myself</em>! Also: those Jacobsons sure know how to feed me, properly!</p>

<img align="right" src="http://suderman.me/xmas2011/hotel.jpg" width="300" height="337" />

<p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;">Later that month (and after Sudermanor's 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual November Christmas Party), the dodgeball team organized yet another trip together. This time: Kalispell, Montana. The big idea was Black Friday shopping&mdash;I can assure you we got the full, insane experience. Thankfully, nobody was trampled at Walmart&hellip; but I can hardly see myself ever again needing to shop at 1:30 in the morning; nor do I feel compelled to wait another hour in Best Buy&#x27;s checkout line, in the wee hours, when all decent people are asleep in their beds. ;-) I do love visiting the USA, though; they have Cherry Coke!</p>


                      <p style="font-family: Georgia, Garamond, serif; color: #222; font-size: 15px; margin: 0 0 15px 0; line-height: 2; text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="first" style="color:#d10b0b; font-size:30px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1;">D</span>ecember: I suppose I was saving the best for last.</strong> After a month of emails, phone calls and text messages, my girlfriend, Janessa, moved to Calgary&mdash;and I&#x27;ve had the best Christmas I can remember! It&#x27;s been filled with family, friends, food, games, horseback riding, food, snow tubing, parties, hot tubs, and food. Did I mention food? Please people, for my own health's sake, you must keep any chocolate and eggnog <em>away</em> from my peripherals! I'M WEAK. ;-)</p>

I hope you have a spectacular year and that God blesses you and yours.</p>
